org-bib --- Organize kindle books, PDF books and papers with org-mode


* Utils

- bibimport: Import books, possibly cleaning them.  For each book: build a bibid based on the metadata, add an entry to a bib file, copy the book to a centralized location with a name built from the bibid, and add the clippings to an org-mode file assuming that the kindle clipping file is present (either as /Volumes/Kindle/documents/My Clippings.txt or as kindle-clippings.txt in the current directory.)

- azwclean: Ugly hack to clean up drm without too much noise and with dashified names.

- docmeta: Interactive wrapper around some parts of ebook-meta, one of the apps that come with calibre, that helps improve book metadata (and lookup the book in several reference sites).

- bookclips: Extracts clippings associated to books from the Kindle clippings file (to be found in the kindle as "documents/My Clippings.txt") and produces, for all the books in the command line,
  + a unique id, usable by bibtex and as the canonical file name for the different formats;
  + a text version;
  + an org-mode formatted entry including all the metadata and all the book's clippings, with links to the position in the text version of the book where they appear.
